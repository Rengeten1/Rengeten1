ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m a 2nd semester student of Artificial Intelligence ðŸ¤–, learning how to learn, thinking how to think, still figuring out what to think in a world overflowing with binary logic and beautiful UIs.

ðŸŒ± Currently exploring:

Data Structures & Algorithms

Python, C++, Node.js, Expressif, Java and Javascript

How machines "understand" things

Git, GitHub, and the philosophy of clean commits

ðŸ§  I believe in:

Recursive curiosity

Building before mastering

Failing forward (and pushing anyway)

ðŸ§  Python Chatbot with sockets â€“ learning how conversations flow over networks

ðŸŽ® C++ Game Engine â€“ building the rules before playing the game

ðŸ”§ C++ Language Compiler â€“ because writing a compiler makes you question everything

ðŸ“š Favorite debug ritual:

Panic

Tea

Print statements everywhere

Letâ€™s build stuff that learns while we do.

git commit -m "curiosity updated"
