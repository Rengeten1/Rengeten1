👋 Hey, I’m a 2nd-semester Artificial Intelligence student 🤖 — learning how to learn, thinking how to think, still deciding what’s worth thinking in a world running on binary logic and beautiful UIs.

🌱 Currently diving into:

Python & Prompt Engineering

LangChain & LLMs

GPT Wrappers & Tool Integration

Machine Learning fundamentals

Cloud deployment (Azure)

🛠️ Building:

Traffic Law Chatbot – Node.js, Express, React, Bootstrap, Azure

Custom GPT Wrapper – Lightweight, extensible interface to interact with LLMs

📚 Debug ritual:

Panic → Tea → print() everywhere

Let’s build systems that learn as we do.

```bash
git commit -m "curiosity upgraded"
```
