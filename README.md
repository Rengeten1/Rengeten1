ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m a 2nd semester student of Artificial Intelligence ðŸ¤–, learning how to learn, thinking how to think, still figuring out what to think in a world overflowing with binary logic and beautiful UIs.

ðŸŒ± Currently exploring:

Python, C++, Node.js, Expressif, Java and Javascript

Currently building: 
 
ðŸ§  Traffic Law Chatbot â€“ Using Node.js, Expressif, React, Bootstrap and deploying on Azure. (Work in Progress!)

ðŸ“š Favorite debug ritual:

- Panic - Tea - Print statements everywhere

Letâ€™s build stuff that learns while we do.
   ```
git commit -m "curiosity updated"
   ```
